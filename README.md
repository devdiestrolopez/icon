# The Icon Project
The Icon project provides a modern, type-safe solution for handling icons in Android applications. It's composed of two distinct libraries to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maximize reusability. The `icon-core-android` library defines the core API, while `icon-compose-android` offers a ready-to-use Composable component for Jetpack Compose.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Unified API:** A single `IconResource` sealed interface to represent both vector drawables and Compose ImageVectors.

- **Type Safety:** Compile-time safety and IDE auto-completion by eliminating the need to pass raw resource IDs.

- **Seamless Integration:** A drop-in `Icon` composable that works gracefully with both types of icon resources.

- **Composable-first:** Built specifically for use with Jetpack Compose.

## üöÄ Setup
To use the libraries in your project, you'll need to add the Maven repository and declare the dependencies in your Gradle files.

### 1. Add the Maven Repository
Make sure `mavenCentral()` is listed in the `repositories` block in your project's top-level `settings.gradle.kts` file.

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
dependencyResolutionManagement {
  repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
  }
}
```

### 2. Add the Dependencies
You can use the libraries independently, but for most projects, you'll only need to import the `icon-compose-android` library.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts (module level)
dependencies {
  val iconCoreAndroidVersion = <latest-version>
  val iconComposeAndroidVersion = <latest-version>

  // (Optional) Only if the core IconResource and its data classes are needed.
  implementation("io.github.devdiestrolopez.icon.core:icon-core-android:$iconCoreAndroidVersion")

  // Automatically provides the public API of icon-core-android.
  implementation("io.github.devdiestrolopez.icon.compose:icon-compose-android:$iconComposeAndroidVersion")
}
```

## üíª Compatibility
The project is regularly tested with the following technology stack. For a complete list of dependencies and their versions, refer to each of the libraries' `build.gradle.kts` files and the `libs.versions.toml` inside the `gradle` folder.

| Technology | Version |
| -------- | ------- |
| Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) | 8.12.1 |
| Kotlin | 2.2.10 |
| Compose BOM | 2025.08.00 |
| minSdk | 28 |
| targetSdk | 36 |
| compileSdk | 36 |

## üì¶ icon-core-android
This is the central API library. It provides the type-safe `IconResource` sealed interface and its implementations.

### How It Works
This library defines a simple but powerful API. It's a foundational component that establishes a common contract for icons across your application.

- **IconResource:** A sealed interface that ensures all possible icon types are known at compile time, enabling exhaustive when expressions.

- **DrawableResource:** Wraps a standard Android `@DrawableRes` integer ID.

- **ImageVectorResource:** Wraps a Compose ImageVector.

This separation allows other libraries (like `icon-compose-android`) to build components that can accept any `IconResource` type.

```kotlin
// Example of a function that accepts any IconResource
fun processIcon(icon: IconResource) {
  when (icon) {
    is DrawableResource -> // Handle drawable resource (icon.id)
    is ImageVectorResource -> // Handle ImageVector (icon.vector)
  }
}
```

## üé® icon-compose-android
This library provides a drop-in `Icon` composable for Jetpack Compose. It's built on top of the `icon-core-android` library and automatically handles rendering the different types of `IconResource`s you provide.

### How It Works
The library contains a single `Icon` composable that takes an `IconResource` parameter. It uses a when expression to determine the specific icon type and renders it using the appropriate Compose APIs (`painterResource()` for `DrawableResource` and `rememberVectorPainter()` for `ImageVectorResource`). All the rendering logic is handled internally, providing a clean and consistent API for your UI.

### Usage
The `Icon` composable is a direct replacement for the standard Compose Material 3 Icon component.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen() {
  // Example with a drawable resource
  Icon(
    iconResource = DrawableResource(id = R.drawable.ic_my_icon),
    contentDescription = "A custom drawable icon"
  )
  
  // Example with a Compose ImageVector
  Icon(
    iconResource = ImageVectorResource(vector = Icons.Default.Favorite),
    contentDescription = "A favorite icon"
  )
}
```

## üîó Use with iconset-generator plugin
These libraries can be used as standalone components. However, their full value is realized when used in conjunction with the `iconset-generator-plugin`. The plugin streamlines icon management by automatically generating type-safe code that can be used directly with these libraries.

To understand how to add the plugin and how it works, please refer to its documentation in the [IconSet Generator Plugin](https://github.com/devdiestrolopez/icon-set-generator)

## Example Composable Usage
This example makes use of the generated `IconSet` provided by `iconset-generator` plugin.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen() {
  Icon(
    iconResource = IconSet.MyIcon,
    contentDescription = "My first icon",
    modifier = Modifier.size(48.dp)
  )

  Icon(
    iconResource = IconSet.AnotherIcon,
    contentDescription = "My second icon",
    modifier = Modifier.size(48.dp)
  )
}
```
